Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me 
swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, 
as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so 
that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of 
the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the 
door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rat- 
tle of the wheels as the carriage drove away. 

Tt was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fum- 
bled about looking for matches, and muttering under his 
breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the 
passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direc- 
tion. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in 
her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face 
forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, 
and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark. 
dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few 
words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a ques- 
tion, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosylla- 
ble she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her 
hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in 
her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence 
she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in 
his hand. 

** Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room 
for a few minutes, said he, throwing open another door. It 
was a quiet, little, plainly-furnished room, with a round table 
in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. 
Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium 
beside the door. I shall not keep you waiting an instant, 
said he, and vanished into the darkness. 

T glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my 
ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treat- 
ises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I 
walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some 
glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, 
was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house.
